a multi-genre project by Caleb Walz.



## a letter

Dear reader,

When I first chose to write about the value of life, I didn’t really know what I was getting into. To be fair, I didn’t really know what I was getting into with the entire project. But choosing a topic as broad as the value of life really made me struggle later. I had no idea what to write about for any of my genres, because I could write about almost anything—abortion, suicide, euthanasia, and on and on. So many things have to do with the value of life, because everything that we do affects lives. But then, I realized that this was also a blessing—because I could write about anything. I began to look at the big picture, how the way we perceive the value of life changes based on little things and big things. I started the project with the intent of convincing people that all life has value, but I think—I hope—that I have been able to do more than that. I hope that you will learn about the value of life. I hope that you will find how all life has value, even if you can’t immediately see it. And most importantly, I hope that you will be able to find your value in the one place, the one person, that will never change: God. So as you read, explore. Discover. Learn. And maybe, just maybe, value life a little bit more.

## life: priceless, or just pricey?

![](https://calebwalz.github.io/static/images/graph1.png)

The government puts monetary value on life, so that they can make decisions about medical or other benefits. This value varies from situation to situation. The standard for the monetary value of life is only **$50,000**. However, some patients need much more than that to stay alive. At some point, even the government has to make the decision: _at what point is it okay to stop trying to save a life?_



## the government is confused

Speaking along those lines, here's a meme:

![](https://calebwalz.github.io/static/images/meme.png)

The meme shows how the government is trying to use math, numbers, and money to calculate the value of a life. The lady (representing the government) is confused, because it's not working. You can't use numbers to find the value of a human life; it's not that easy.



## ask the audience

Well, if it's not as easy as 2 + 2, then how _do_ we find value in life? Well, I took a poll of the Honors English 10 students to see if they could come up with the answer. First, I wanted some background information. So, I asked them to say if they had lost a loved one at some point in their lives, and if so, how old were they?

This provided some interesting results. Most responders had experienced the death of a loved one, although the ages were evenly split between "over thirteen" and "under thirteen." The final question I had for them was to sum up the meaning of life in three words. That was a very hard question to answer, but I managed to get some good results. Most of them were about God, family, or friends, but some opted for a more unique approach. (Chicken nugget sauce. Really?) Since most responders said they had experienced the death of a loved one, I can assume that the experience with death has been able to make them see what the value of life truly is. Some things we don't really appreciate until they're gone.



## reaching out

Have you ever thought about what it is to be alive? Do it, if you aren’t already. Just take a few minutes and think about what it means for you to be alive—all the experiences, interactions, and observations that you have. I’ll wait.

Done? Okay. Keep those thoughts in your head. Now think about someone else that you know, and apply the same question. Think about that person’s experiences and observations. Put yourself in his or her shoes. Imagine what it is like to be that person.

Did you realize how much you didn’t know?

Depending on how close you are to the person you just thought about, you might have been able to construct a pretty clear picture of their life. But there were mostly likely some huge gaps. I have a twin brother, and I spend a good portion of my time with him—but even I don’t know what he’s doing 100 percent of the time. And even if I do, I don’t know what he’s feeling or thinking while he’s doing it. But that doesn’t mean that he isn’t having any thoughts or feelings; I just can’t see them. Generally, there’s a pretty big gap between how much we know about someone and how much that person is really experiencing.

Now realize that there are 7.6 billion other people on this planet whose thoughts and feelings and lives you also can’t possibly begin to see, hear or experience. 7.6 billion people with thoughts like yours, emotions like yours, lives like yours.

It’s kind of mind-blowing, isn’t it? Way too often, we go through life like it’s some kind of movie—starring ourselves. Everyone else is just a supporting character, or even an extra, in the film of our lives. But that’s not how life works. Everybody has a story just as finely detailed and crafted as your own. It’s what makes us human.

I think that humanity could benefit a lot from thinking about this simple fact a bit more. Too often, we form opinions about others purely based on little things they do to us. For example, just because someone snaps at you in class doesn’t make them a jerk. They might just be having a bad day. Maybe you ran into them in the hallway because you didn’t see them because you were talking with your friends. Or maybe it’s something else. My point is, countless things happen in other people’s lives that influence their actions, and we have to take that into consideration. If we can understand people—truly understand them, as well as we understand ourselves—then we can truly find the value in their lives. Because knowing, understanding, feeling another life as if it was your own? That’s called love. It’s respect. It’s understanding what it really means to value life.



## my sister, a stranger

I’m sure it’s easy for you to agree that life matters, when you look around at the people you know. I don’t think that anybody would really wish death upon their friends, or even  some other misfortune. But what about strangers? What about the people we don’t know, have never met; those faces you pass while you’re walking down the sidewalk? I still don’t believe that anybody would just intentionally wish death upon a stranger, but would you care if, one day, that stranger didn’t show up to work? Would you care if  you stopped seeing that person—if he or she simply disappeared?

How much do you value the lives of people you don’t even know?

I want to talk about a moment in my life when I learned to value a stranger’s life. I was in kindergarten, living in Texas. Life back then was pretty simple, at least for me: eat, school, play, sleep. Repeat. I didn’t really have to worry about anything. That is, until my mom made the announcement that she was pregnant. I was going to have a new baby sister. But there was a very important addition to this, as well—she was going to have Down’s syndrome. At the time, I didn’t really know what that meant. I just knew she was going to be different.

I was really excited. I remember drawing little pictures to put in her room so that they were the first thing she saw when she woke up. I remember Mom and Dad getting the room ready, converting our office into a little baby room because we didn’t have another one. These are happy things—to me, this was a happy time. But there are other things that I don’t remember, and I have to fill in the gaps with what I know now.
I know now that there were complications. Issues. I remember about the Down’s syndrome, but like I said, I didn’t fully understand what that would mean. I know now that her birth, and her condition, would have changed our lives in ways I could never imagine. I know now that one of my mother’s doctors suggested, prompted, even pressured her to get an abortion. She always knew that was an option, but now I can admire her strength in that she never once even considered it. How could she let a child that she loved die?

And yet, that’s what happened.

On January 23, I was pulled out of my kindergarten class. My mom was standing in the doorway to the classroom. I saw her face, and I knew something was wrong. My brothers and I were taken over to the church, and we were told the bad news—my mother had a miscarriage. Sarah Grace Walz was no longer alive. I remember crying a little, and watching my mother cry a lot. I remember staying at my grandparents’ house for a bit, while things settled down. I remember the cremation. I remember my mom, describing how tiny Sarah Grace’s little body was in her hands.

I remember days, months, years passing, life returning to normal.

Except it really didn’t. We don’t talk about Sarah Grace much anymore, but there’s always a bit of a sadness hanging over our family, and especially over Mom, every January 24. Some people might think that’s it. That Sarah Grace’s life didn’t have much value—or even that she didn’t have a life at all. She didn’t really accomplish anything. She had a disability that would never allow her to see the world as we saw it. She wasn’t even born. But the four months she was alive changed lives. Sarah Grace changed our family. I never saw her personally, but I can see her now in all of our lives. And so, even though I didn’t really get to know her, I know that her life still has value. Maybe she isn’t quite as much of a stranger to me as someone who was just walking past on the street would be. But those people have lives, too. And those lives? They have value. Whether the life lasts for 80 years or for 8 months, that life is the life of a person created in the image of God. Don’t let anyone take that away.



## a new perspective

Let's gain a new look on the situation through an interview with my mother.

**Describe an experience in which you grew to understand another person’s value.**
Well, when I had my children, and especially when I was pregnant with my daughter (Sarah Grace). When I was pregnant with her, I found out that there was a complication,  most likely a genetic abnormality. While my doctor never pushed abortion, the genetic counselor definitely did. I was very angry, because she kept saying the we didn’t have to keep putting ourselves through this, that we could choose to end the pregnancy, tat we did have a choice, and things like that. But what she was suggesting is that we just kill our daughter.

**How do you see value in other people’s lives? Your own?**
Everybody has been given gifts, and everybody has a purpose. And our value doesn’t even just come from what we can do; it comes from the fact that we are dearly loved children of God.

**Do you think that all people’s lives have value?**
Yes.

**Why does human life have value?**
God tells us it does. We are created by Him and our lives have value and purpose, even if we don’t always see it.


**Kind of random, but what would you do in this situation: you’re a train switch operator, your child is on one track but the other is blocked. Do you have all the people on the train die, or your child?**
I don’t know. The obvious answer is to save more lives, but if it was my child I don’t know if I could.

**Related to the last question, do you feel that you value lives which you know more than strangers?**
I think that’s pretty typical. But it’s not that I don’t think other people have worth.

**How can we reflect the value of people in our daily actions?**
By looking for opportunities to serve them or brighten their days, even in little ways. And ultimately, to be kind and loving.



## gave up

![](https://calebwalz.github.io/static/images/ad.jpg)

People often get abortions because they have given up. They don't think that they can do it anymore. But each abortion cuts short a true human life. Does that life not have value just because it's hard for the mother?



## dark to light

They say that if you’re lost at night  
A light will guide the way.  
But how will I know what’s wrong or right  
When I can’t see, but it’s day?

I’m blinded by the darkness now—  
Can’t see, don’t know, don’t care.  
But someone, somewhere, might know how  
My little life to spare.

I looked and looked, but I couldn’t find  
A way to get back home.  
But the Father came to me from behind—  
No longer would I roam.  

I know my purpose: ‘tis to be  
A guide away from death.  
God’s light in me to help them see  
To take one final breath.



## between young and old

“Whoa. Where am I? What is this place? Who are you?”

“Unfortunately, I can only answer one of those questions. My name is Liesel. It is good to meet you, little girl. What is your name?”

“Anna. What are you doing here?”

“Waiting, I suppose.”

“For what?”

“For you.”

“Well, why? Why were you waiting on me?”

“I need to tell you something. You see, I’ve seen many things in my life. I’ve seen many deaths. I’ve seen humans treating other humans as if they were animals being prepared for the slaughter. Through all these experiences, I’ve been able to see that all humans have value. I think you need may need to hear that right now.”

“...yes. How did you know?”

“Sometimes, I just do. You see, what you are trying to do for your sister is noble, in a way. But you need to understand, and she needs to understand, that her life has value. No one can just take that away on purpose. Trust me—life leaves us quickly enough without our help.”

“So... I should be donating a kidney to my sister, even if she’ll die anyway and I might die from the procedure.”

“That choice is ultimately up to you. However, I know that I would do whatever I could to get back the ones I lost many years ago. Life is valuable, Anna. Do what you can to save it.”



## safe in his hands

![](https://calebwalz.github.io/static/images/image.jpg)

This image depicts the source of our value: God. In God we find true value, as He takes care of us every day. Some people might look at that baby and think that it has no value. It hasn't proven itself. Maybe it shouldn't have even been born. But God takes each and every one of us into His hands and protects our lives as precious.



## saving lives

So now that we know that lives have value, what do we do? We save them. You might at this point ask, _How to save a life?_ Well, I have just the video for you.

<p class="aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9">

The video describes how we often see people just for what they do, rather than who they are. However, when we begin to realize who they truly are, and that they have value, we can help them see that as well. It doesn't have to be big. You can save a life through a simple hand.
