## life: priceless, or just pricey?

The government puts monetary value on life, so that they can make decisions about medical or other benefits. This value varies from situation to situation. The standard for the monetary value of life is only **$50,000**. However, some patients need much more than that to stay alive. At some point, even the government has to make the decision: _at what point is it okay to stop trying to save a life?_



## the government is confused

Speaking along those lines, here's a meme:

The meme shows how the government is trying to use math, numbers, and money to calculate the value of a life. The lady (representing the government) is confused, because it's not working. You can't use numbers to find the value of a human life; it's not that easy.



## ask the audience

Well, if it's not as easy as 2 + 2, then how _do_ we find value in life? Well, I took a poll of the Honors English 10 students to see if they could come up with the answer. First, I wanted some background information. So, I asked them to say if they had lost a loved one at some point in their lives, and if so, how old were they?

This provided some interesting results. Most responders had experienced the death of a loved one, although the ages were evenly split between "over thirteen" and "under thirteen." The final question I had for them was to sum up the meaning of life in three words. That was a very hard question to answer, but I managed to get some good results. Most of them were about God, family, or friends, but some opted for a more unique approach. (Chicken nugget sauce. Really?) Since most responders said they had experienced the death of a loved one, I can assume that the experience with death has been able to make them see what the value of life truly is. Some things we don't really appreciate until they're gone.
